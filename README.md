## Description

* The Islandora Webform (IW) module uses the capabilities of the standard Drupal Webform module to enable users to submit comments (captions, tags, transcriptions, etc.) on digital objects in an Islandora repository.
* In Islandora, a link to the webform appears on the page of qualifying repository objects. When clicked by an authorized visitor, the link launches the webform that gathers data from the user and puts the submitted data into a queue waiting for approval by a webform manager.
* When the submission is approved, the form values are ingested either 1) into the MODS (or another specific datastream) of the Fedora object being commented on, or 2) into a completely new Fedora object. If 2) is used, a relationship statement is placed in the RELS-EXT datastream connecting the submission Fedora object to the original Fedora object.
* All the submissions for a specific object can then be displayed along with the original object using a dedicated Drupal block.
* The Islandora Webform Ingest module, which is provided with this module and can be enabled separately, provides digital repository curators the ability to directly ingest webform submissions into a datastream of the associated object.
