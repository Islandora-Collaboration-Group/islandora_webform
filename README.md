## Description

This module permits a site manager to create webforms that are associated with islandora objects. A user will see a link on the object page to inviting him or her to contribute information pertaining to this object. Once the user has submitted this information, repository curators can review all submissions for a given webform, or for a given repository object.

The Islandora Webform Ingest module, which is provided with this module and can be enabled separately, provides digital repository curators the ability to directly ingest webform submissions into a datastream of the associated object.

## Documentation

For more complete documentation of how to use islandora_webform and islandora_webform_ingest modules see the [Islandora Webform Documentation](https://github.com/Islandora-Collaboration-Group/icg_information/blob/master/how_to_documentation/help_with_icg_webform__index.md).

## Requirements

* Drupal 7.x

* Webform 7.4.x

* Islandora 7.x with Islandora Collections and at least one Solution Pack enabled.

## Installation

1. Copy the entire islandora_webform directory into the Drupal sites/all/modules directory (or subdirectory).

2. Login as an administrator. Enable the Islandora Webform module in the "Administer" -> "Modules"

3. Create a webform node at node/add/webform.

4. Configure Islandora settings for the webform to define which repository objects can show a link to this webform.

5. If manual webform linking is selected, go to each object that you want to link to a webform, and click the link to add it.

## Configuration

Configuration is found at Islandora > Configuration > Islandora Webform (/admin/islandora/configure/iw).

1. "Webform link behavior": If not using inline webforms with webform_ajax, this controls whether clicking on a webform link opens a new page/tab or replaces the current window.

2. "Append webform links to bottom of object view?": Uncheck this if you want to override the normal positioning of the webform links below the object display.

## Permissions

This module defines the following permissions:

1. Manage Islandora Webform - enable for roles that should be able to add webform links to objects generally.

2. Link islandora objects to webforms - when manual webform linking is selected, enable for roles to add webform links on individual objects.

## SOLR/GSearch Configuration

When a Fedora object is manually linked to a webform, enabling the link to appear on the object page, a new datastream "WF" is created on the object, containing a list of the node ids of all associated webforms. In order for a site builder to make a view of all objects that are associated with a given webform, SOLR and GSearch need to be configured to index the contents of that datastream.
**TODO -** Instructions for how to do this are needed!

## Enabling and configuring Islandora Webform Ingest

See the README.txt inside the submodules/islandora_webform_ingest folder for installation and usage instructions for the Islandora Webform Ingest module.

## Upgrading from previous versions

1. MAKE A DATABASE BACKUP. Upgrading this module may entail a number of database changes. If you encounter an error and need to downgrade, you must restore the previous database. You can make a database backup with your hosting provider, using the Backup and Migrate module, or from the command line.

2. Copy the entire islandora_webform directory the Drupal modules directory, replacing the old copy. DO NOT KEEP THE OLD COPY in the same directory or anywhere Drupal could possibily find it. Delete it from the server.

3. Login as an administrative user or change the $update_free_access in update.php to TRUE.

4. Run update.php (at http://www.example.com/update.php).
